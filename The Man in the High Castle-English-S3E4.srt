00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,473
SAMPSON:
You know, some folks might say

3
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,350
you look
kind of Jewish yourself.

4
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,602
Just shut the fuck up.

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,439
One more word out of you,
and I'll blow your head off.

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,529
No monkey business.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,910
Uh, Mark Sampson here
for Father Finn.

8
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,830
(indistinct chatter)

(bell clanging)

10
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:46,130
SAMPSON:
See, I told ya.

11
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,007
Nothing but Jesus here.

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,967
Just drive.

13
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,896
(car doors close,
dog barking)

14
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,856
SAMPSON:
Oh, good morning, Father.

15
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,691
Oh, you're just in time
for Mass.

16
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,109
Well, lucky me.

17
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,778
Who's your friend?

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,197
Oh, just another child of God.

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,990
Welcome, Brother.

20
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,451
Join us.

21
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,829
Hey, Padre,
dominus vobiscum.

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,832
Et cum spiritu tuo.

23
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,251
(bell clanging)

24
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,757
Give me the keys.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,722
(dog barking)

26
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,141

27
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,562
-The body of Christ.
-WOMAN: Amen.

28
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,106
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

29
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,110
The body of Christ.

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,116
I knew it. You're a goddamn Jew,
and you're gonna give me

31
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,702
-every Jew you got hidden here.
-MAN: He's not a Jew.

32
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,412
Who said that?

33
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,873
Stand up and let me see you.

34
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,127
(people murmuring)

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,799
Take me instead.

36
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,971
I'm a Jew, he's not.

37
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
He's got the number, the tattoo.

38
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,559
He did that in solidarity
with the many murdered millions.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,812
Now come on, take it easy.

40
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,189
-Put the gun down.
-You just back the fuck off.

41
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,191
Don't move, none of you!

42
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,235
I'm a Jew. Take me.

43
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:34,738
-Sit down. -No, no.
I'm the Jew. Just take me.

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,323
I'll take both of you
if you want.

45
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,741
The three of you, in fact.

46
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,785
-I'm a Jew. Take me.
-Hey.

47
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,203
-I'm a Jew.
-You shut up.

48
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,496
-PEOPLE: I'm a Jew. Take me.
-Just

49
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,623
sit the fuck down, all of you!

50
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,709
I'll shoot this fake Jew priest
right now.

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,544
FRANK:
No one needs to get hurt.

52
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,588
-All right?
-(woman whimpering)

53
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,715
Just take it easy.

54
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,718
Just put down the gun.

55
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,265
Just put down the gun.

56
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,435
(gunshot,
people whimpering, shrieking)

57

-(people murmuring, crying)

58
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,024
What the hell was that?

59
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,610
I could have talked him down.

60
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,944
He would have surrendered.

61
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,988
And then what?

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,532
Huh? We're becoming careless.

63
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,950
SAMPSON:
Lila, he got

64
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,827
the drop on me in Denver. I...

65
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,495
I fucked up. Sorry.

I have... nothing to do.

139

Why don't you get out the house,
go for a walk?

It would do you some good.

00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,408
Whatever happened
to that film I gave you?

168
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,747
I delivered it to Smith.

169
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,918
Whatever happened to Frank?

170
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,133
I don't know.
He disappeared.

171
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,307
So you're still in touch
with the Resistance?

172
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,642
No. I left that behind.

173
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,938
You still looking
for the Man in the High Castle?

174
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,442
No. No, that was Smith's
obsession, not mine.

175
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,694
Speaking of Smith,

176
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,155
you said he manipulated you.

177
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,367
I'm curious.

178
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,786
What kind of deal
did you have to make?

179
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
I gave him my father.

180
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,589
(birds singing,
crow cawing)

181
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,216
Oh, hey, hey.

182
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,469
Hi, Dad.

183
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,513
(laughing):
Well, I missed you, too.

184
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,640
-Hey, Pop.
-Lunch is ready.

185
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,267
I'm starving. Let's go.

186
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,895
-You coming, Pop?
-In a minute, Charlie.

187
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,197
That was a hell of a thing
this morning.

188
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,825
-Oh, you don't think he was
coming for me, do you? -No.

189
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,701
He's just some cheap
bounty hunter.

190
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,205
I've seen enough killing
for one lifetime.

191
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,457
Yeah, I wish
there were another way.

192
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,710
Well, there is. This,
what you're doing here. This.

193
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,464
There's something
I want to show you.

194
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,051
(Frank sighs)

195
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:02,389
I've been working on this.

196
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,015
Huh?

197
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,560
Well, who's that supposed to be?
The Kempeitai?

198
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,855
No, the fascists in general.
The secret police everywhere.

199
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,608
The-the internalized oppression

200
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,236
of subjugated people
all over the world.

201
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,238
Yeah, well, it looks
like Kido to me.

202
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,659
Ah, any resemblance is...
strictly coincidental.

203
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,703
(Sampson laughs)

204
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,664
Well?

205
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, it scares me shitless.

206
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,294
Good. Good, it should.

207
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,963
Now, the sunrise--
it represents hope,

208
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,717
the promise and possibility
of a new day, a new dawn.

209
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,303
But this, this man--
this is the necessary next step,

210
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,140
a reminder of the forces
of darkness arrayed

211
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,392
to prevent that new dawn.

212
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,352
What? You think
people don't already know?

213
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:54,191
No, I think they've forgotten,
or, you know, they never knew.

214
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:00,030
They think this world is normal,
and it's not.

215
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,159
You said my, uh... my sunrise
was all over the Pacific States.

216
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,077
Yeah, and the Neutral Zone.

217
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,914
Ah, great.

218
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,540
All right, look,

219
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,959
I made posters.

220
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,961
Take them back with you.
I want you to put them up.

221
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,214
Yeah, there's-there's something
you should know.

222
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,549
Um...

223
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,552
people are-are not
only putting up your art.

224
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,471
They're copying it.
Young people, especially.

225
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,474
They're-they're making it
their own.

226
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,727
FRANK:
Ah, this is fantastic.

227
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,145
-Yeah.
-All the more reason why we...

228
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,648
Look, they're arresting people,
Frank.

229
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,358
-I don't want anyone
to get hurt. -Well, look,

230
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,360
in a way,
it's out of your hands.

231
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,362
Th-These sunrises,

232
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,822
they d... they don't even belong
to you anymore. But this,

233
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,825
this is really gonna get
the Pons' attention.

234
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,827
-And not in a good way.
-You said people need to see

235
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,163
-all this. -Yeah, and-and,
one day, the time will be right.

236
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,707
And when it is, I promise you

237
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,543
that we will wallpaper
these sons of bitches

238
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,753
like nobody's business.

239
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,438
SMITH:
Cause of death?

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,691
BERG:
Blunt force trauma.

241
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,736
Was he compromised?

242
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,781
Some animal activity.

243
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,325
But no signs of torture.

244
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,664
Thank you, Doctor.

245
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,133
What exactly did he say
about us?

246
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,969
Uh, that St. Theresa's
hides Jews.

247
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,054
And that rumor has it

248
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,390
there's a whole nest of us up
here in the mountains somewhere.

249
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,809
Ugh. Well, that worries me.

250
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,895
I think most folks think
that Sabra is a folk legend.

251
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,356
Like Sh-Shangri-La, you know?

252
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,110
-Sabra, the Lost Colony
of Semites. -(chuckles)

253
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:06,031
(chuckles) Not too far
from the truth then, huh?

254
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,325
Well, let's hope
no one misses this bastard

255
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,576
and comes here looking for him.

256
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,536
There.

257
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm gonna head into town.

258
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,376
Pick up some supplies,

259
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,879
see if there's any chatter.

260
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,964
What will you do without me,

261
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,175
you up here all alone?

262
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,178
Well, I will study my Torah

263
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,096
and try not to make a fool out
of myself

264
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,514
-at the bar mitzvah.
-(chuckles)

265
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,183
We'll be calling you Rabbi yet.

266
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,603
Reb Sampson, thank you.

267
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,980
I like it.

268
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,942
(insects trilling)

269
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,321
Marks, not yen.

270
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,697
How much?

271
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,948
Twenty-five.

272
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,242
25,000 marks?

273
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,829
Well, it's a big fucking ask.

274
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,590
The trade minister?

275
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,050
Mm-hmm.

276
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,346
Well, my price...

277
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,597
just went up.

278
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,016
Fifty.

279
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,897
Take it or leave it.

280
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,358
(exhales)

281
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,276
Your contact?

282
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,112
Solid gold.

283
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,947
Got a man inside.

284
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,367
Inside the Kempeitai?
How'd you manage that?

285
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,703
(chuckles)

286
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,122
All right.

287
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,917
I need associates, addresses,
business connections--

288
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,836
everything
the Kempeitai has on him.

289
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,754
What makes you think
they got anything on him?

290
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,925
Well, because Chief Inspector
Kido keeps an eye on him.

291
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,428
They have a thick file.

292
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,346
Believe me.

293
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,777
-Domo. Konichiwa.
-Konichiwa.

294
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,612
Suimasen.

295
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,031
Trade Minister, Tagomi-san.

296
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,910
What a wonderful view.

297
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,829
Ah, suimasen.

298
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,998
Arigato.

299
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,167
-My painting.
-(speaks Japanese)

300
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,918
(speaks Japanese)

301
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,670
Uh...

302
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,213
-Some tea?
-Ah.

303
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,214
That is okay.

304
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,883
I'm... I can't stay.

305
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,718
Ah.

306
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,053
I hope I'm not being
too forward, but...

307
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,722
I was wondering if

308
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,141
you'd like to come over
to my house for dinner.

309
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,726
Uh, yes, yes.

310
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,311
Of-of course. Ah.

311
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,062
Wonderful.

312
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,398
I'll cook you
some Okinawan food.

313
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,858
My mother's recipes.

314
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,027
-That would be wonderful.
-(chuckles)

315
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,904
Shall we say Saturday? At 7:00?

316
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,447
Yes. 7:00 is fine.

317
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,698
Well,

318
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,700
see you then.

319
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
(doors slide open)

320
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,381
ED:
But John Wayne was married.

321
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,134
So was I, sugar. So was I.

322
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,678
The Duke gave me this

323
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,389
just before he left
to fight with the Rebels.

324
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,185
And... this is the belt buckle
he wore in Stagecoach?

325
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,561
Mm-hmm.

326
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,438
Stagecoach is my favorite Ford.

327
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,441
Yeah, I just...

328
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,319

496

JULIANA:
(clears throat) I, um...

497
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm sorry. There's...

498
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,358
no ice.

499
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,945
-(clears throat)
-Cheers.

500
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,909
What's all this?

501
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,663
Uh, there's a place called, um,
Lackawanna,

502
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,748
in Pennsylvania.

503
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,208
Ring a bell?

504
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,835
Mmm. Should it?

505
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:16,213
It's somewhere in the Poconos.

506
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:22,261
You planning on taking
a vacation to the Reich?

507
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,847
(chuckles) Of course not.

508
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,476
Then what's with the map?

509
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,144
Just got interested.

510
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,776
Do you believe in past lives?

511
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,403
Other lives?

512
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,113
Reichsfuhrer Himmler does.

513
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,283
So maybe there's
something to it.

514
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:47,953
Hey.

515
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,290
Me, uh, no.

516
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,875
Not so much.

517
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,171
Listen...

518
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,051
I have a memory
of a place, this place.

519
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,637
And I'm sure I've been there,
but I haven't.

520
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:08,265
Not in this life.

521
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,852
JOE:
It's déjà vu.

522
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,522
Everybody has those moments.

523
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,026
I'm sure I've been there
with you.

524
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,280
I wish.

525
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,164
I'm sure I've been here
with you, too.

526
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,917
Many, many times.

527
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,878
Me, too.

528
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,673
I've imagined this moment...

529
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,175
many times.

530
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,527
TAGOMI:
Howard Wexler.

531
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,197
Who is he?

532
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,657
A defector from the Reich.

533
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,867
Like Diels.

534
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,246
Only much more valuable.
A researcher.

535
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,166
I believe it was the same
assassin in both cases.

536
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,169
Wexler was working with
your ministry.

537
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,883
On a project I cannot discuss.

538
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:32,057
The Nazis are doing their best
to sabotage us.

539
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,727
And they are succeeding.

540
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,228
These street protests...

541
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,106
The street protests are
under control.

542
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:43,027
The agitators
are suffering for oil.

543
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,946
Kerosene. Gasoline.

544
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:49,033
Heating oil.

545
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,785
What are you doing about it,

546
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,079
Trade Minister?

547
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,873
Again,

548
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,627
nothing I will discuss with you,

549
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,630
Chief Inspector.

550
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,311
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

551
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,819
Hey.

552
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,658
Did you sleep?

553
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,369
JULIANA:
I had this dream...

554
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,413
I've had it before.

555
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,416
Something's happened.

556
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,877
And the world's turned to ash,

557
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,963
and then I'm in this tunnel.

558
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,010
With you.

559
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,054
(laughs)

560
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,932
What?

561
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,852
Well, I'm happy to be
a part of your nightmare.

562
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,771
We got to get you out of
this place, Juliana.

563
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,773
It's...

564
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,943
I'd have nightmares
living in a place like this.

565
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,153
We could get away from here.

566
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,155
Go on a trip.

567
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,117
Visit-- what was it called?

568
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,952
Lackawanna.

569
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,913
Yeah, the Poconos.

570
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,040
Yeah, but like you said,
it's in the Reich.

571
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,335
I have my connections.

572
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,255
Yeah, I know you do.

573
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,846
I got to go.

574
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,026
(woman singing in German)

575
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,658
(singing continues)

576
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,454
This apartment, it's... amazing.

577
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,539
My father's New York
pied-à-terre.

578
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:03,000
It's ridiculous, I know.

579
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,502
But I enjoy it.

580
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,346
(laughing): I-I don't think
snooker's my game.

581
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,724
You just need practice.

582
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,059
Come over any time.

583
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,687
In fact, if you really want
to write a column

584
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,064
-about my work...
-Year Zero.

585
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,816
...then perhaps we should meet

586
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,902
on a regular basis.

587
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,696
Well, I want to know
all about it.

588
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,824
How much time do you have?

589
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,041
Wayne's off with a friend
tonight.

590
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,045
Well, in that case...

591
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,803
Mmm.

592
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,643

JOE: I have the plans,
or the... equations?

594
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,406
At least I think I do.

595
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,950
I'm sorry, sir,
I flunked physics.

596
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,035
HIMMLER (on telephone):
You dealt a real blow

597
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,579
to their efforts to copy
our Nebenwelt project.

598
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,665
JOE:
Thank you, sir.

599
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,792
You have a plan

600
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,753
to deal with the trade minister?

601
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,922
I'm working on it, sir.

602
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,258
HIMMLER:
It was through Tagomi's efforts

603
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,552
that the traitor Wexler
defected.

604
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,095
He knows too much.

605
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,182
I just need a little more time,
sir.

606
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,977
HIMMLER:
Well, you are on the ground.

607
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:49,356
That is for you to decide when
and where to strike Tagomi.

608
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,025
But don't delay too long.
