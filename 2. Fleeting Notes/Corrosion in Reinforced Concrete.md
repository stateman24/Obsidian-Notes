- According to Tuutti, there are essential two phases to lifespan of RC 
- The first stage is initiation stage
- The second stage is propagation period 
- At the initialization stage aggressive agent like C02 and chloride penetrate the concrete and reaches the rebar.
- At the propagation period the corrosion reaches a critical level and starts to spread rapidly causing siginificant structural damage.
- Models has been created based on Tuutii's Model to distinguish between rust expansion, cover cracking and spalling/delamination.
- This is done by taking the corrosion rate variation over the reinforced concrete's lifetime into account
