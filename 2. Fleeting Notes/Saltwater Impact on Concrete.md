I need to know the recent and current research on the effect of salt water on concrete, exploring 
 - concrete exposure to saltwater which can reduce compressive, tensile and flexural strength of the concrete 
 - enviromental factors like salt water conc, temperature 
 - chloride ions from salt water accelerating reinforcement corrosion 

Possible research gap targets
-  Saltwater compositon variation effects 
- long term durabiliy of concrete strength 
- influence of enviromental conditions
- mitigation method like look at admixtures to inhibit the action of salt water 
- how does salt affect pore structure, capillary absorption and moisture transport in concrete

Possible research questions
- how doe the concrete strength varies based on the varying salt water content
- what is the rate of chloride ion ingress and reinforcement corrosion in concrete exposed to saltwater over a 90 day period 
- what is the effect of repeated wet-dry saltwater cycle on the micro structure and durability 
- can locally available industrial or by-products mitigate the effects of salt water on concrete 
- how does salt concentration in curing water affect the capillary absorption and permeability of concrete
