If you want to learn Embedded systems, here is progressive roadmap from zero knowledge to advanced firmware engineer.
(Beginner → Advanced)

Embedded systems = writing software that directly controls hardware.
Think:

Drones

Robots

IoT devices

Smart meters

Automotive ECUs

Industrial controllers

🟢 PHASE 0 — Foundations (0–2 Months)

Before touching microcontrollers, build fundamentals.

📚 What To Learn

1️⃣ Basic Electronics

Ohm’s Law

Resistors, capacitors, inductors

Diodes & transistors

Pull-up / pull-down resistors

Voltage dividers

Digital vs Analog signals

2️⃣ Digital Logic

Binary & hexadecimal

Logic gates

Flip flops

PWM concept

ADC vs DAC basics

🛠 Tools

Multimeter

Breadboard

Arduino Uno

📖 Resources

GreatScott! on YouTube

Arduino beginner tutorials




🟡 PHASE 1 — Programming Foundations (1–3 Months)

Embedded systems require strong programming fundamentals.

💻 Required Languages

1️⃣ C (Mandatory — Core Embedded Language)

This is the most important language in embedded systems.
Learn:

Variables & data types

Pointers

Arrays

Structs

Bitwise operations

Memory management

Header files

Why C?
Because microcontrollers are resource-constrained.

2️⃣ C++ (Important for modern embedded & robotics)

Used in:

Arduino

ROS

Advanced firmware frameworks

Learn:

Classes

OOP basics

Constructors

Templates (later stage)

3️⃣ Python (Optional but Powerful)

Used for:

Testing firmware

Automation scripts

Robotics integration

Tools & simulation

📚 Resources

LearnCpp.com (for C++)

freeCodeCamp C course (YouTube)

Harvard CS50 (C fundamentals)

🟠 PHASE 2 — Microcontroller Fundamentals (2–4 Months)

Now you move to real embedded hardware.

📚 What To Learn

1️⃣ Microcontroller Architecture

CPU

Flash memory

SRAM

Registers

Interrupts

Timers

GPIO

Watchdog

2️⃣ Communication Protocols

UART

I2C

SPI

CAN (important for automotive & robotics)

3️⃣ Peripherals

ADC

PWM

Timers

Interrupt handling

🛠 Boards To Practice On

Start simple:

Arduino Uno

Move deeper:

ESP32

STM32 Nucleo

📚 Tools

Arduino IDE

PlatformIO

STM32CubeIDE




🔴 PHASE 3 — Professional Embedded Development (4–8 Months)

This is where things begin to get serious.

📚 What To Learn

1️⃣ Bare-Metal Programming

Writing directly to registers

Reading datasheets

Bit manipulation

Memory maps

2️⃣ RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems)

Tasks

Scheduling

Semaphores

Mutex

Queues

Learn:

FreeRTOS

3️⃣ Debugging 

JTAG debugging

Logic analyzer usage

Oscilloscope usage

Reading crash logs

4️⃣ Power Management

Very important 

Sleep modes

Battery optimization

Low-power design



🟣 PHASE 4 — Advanced & Specialization

Choose your path:

🚁 Embedded for UAVs

Autopilot systems

Sensor fusion

IMU integration

MAVLink protocol

Work with PX4


🤖 Embedded for Robotics

Motor control

PID tuning

Encoder feedback

CAN bus systems



🌍 Embedded IoT

MQTT

WiFi stacks

BLE

Cloud integration


🚗 Automotive Embedded

AUTOSAR

CAN

Functional safety basics



🧠 Essential Skills (Often Ignored)




A Realistic 12-Month Path looks like this

Months 1–2 → Electronics + (C or C++ , Python)
Months 3–4 → Arduino + ESP32 projects
Months 5–6 → STM32 + registers
Months 7–8 → Communication protocols
Months 9–10 → RTOS + advanced debugging
Months 11–12 → Specialization projects (drone, robot, IoT)



🔥 Final Advice (Especially for Nigeria)

Embedded engineering is the foundation of modern Engineering and is necessary for those looking to go into robotics or drone building 

It requires commitment and discipline,  if you follow this roadmap properly and practice you're on your way to becoming an Embedded systems engineer.
