When we pray for others we become aware of the struggles they face, their needs and this can move us to be compassionate. Compassion is an award of an other person’s suffering along with the desire to relieve that suffering, Jesus showed that when he healed the leper in Mark 1:40,41. So praying for our brothers and sisters shows that we have compassion for the m and are aware of the struggles and want Jehovah to help them.
