There are several types of Health and Safety Regulations in the construction industry. They include:

 1. [International Labour Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_labour_law)
 2. Occupational Safety and Health Act
 3. Construction Regulation 2003
 4. Safety and Health Regulations of Construction 
 
So for example, the Occupation Safety and Health Act covers the right of entry, record and reporting of injuries. First in a medical attention, fire protection and prevention in construction covers these areas, and these are what this type of safety and health regulation does. They cover areas in construction to improve the safety planning and help in comprehensive risk assessments to prevent accidents and tragedies on site.
