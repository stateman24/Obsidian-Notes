[[Health and Safety on the Construction site]] also involve information regulation due to the fact that good flow of information and careful regulation of such information improve health and safety of personnel on construction sites. Since construction sites are majorly characterized by interdependencies among people, machineries, and processes, timely and structured communication is essential on-site. This involves site managers to be continually informed about the state of their workflow, equipment, materials, and subcontractors on-site. 
A well-managed information site enables:

 • Prompt resolution of safety issues
 • Efficient coordination
 • Access to teams
 • Transparency in decision-making
 • Stakeholder's confidence and support
 • Accurate reports and documentation for auditing or dispute resolution
