***Philippians 2:3,4*** urges us to not only look out for ourselves but for others as well and this includes prayer for others. We all have individual troubles and struggles but making an habit of praying for our fellow Christian’s can remind us that we are not the only ones experiencing the struggles or challenges, and this can prevent us from be overly concerned about our problems or challenges in which can weigh us down
