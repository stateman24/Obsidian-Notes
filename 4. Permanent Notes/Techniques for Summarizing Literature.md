One major technique researchers use to summarize literature[^1] to extract what is most relevant to the research problem or question. For example relevant informations from an article that talks about the effects of salt on concrete while the research problem is how saline water affects concrete properties. The technique involves 3 key elements for every study [^2]
1. The **focus** which captures the intent or scope of the study
2. The **findings** which highlights the main results show that the researcher of the study discovered 
3. The conclusion which reflect the interpretation, implication or recommendation that the author drew for their work
