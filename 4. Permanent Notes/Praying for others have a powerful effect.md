Praying for other can change the outcome of situations of our fellow brothers an example is the case of apostle Paul, in his letter to Philemon where he hopes that their prayers would improve his situation (his imprisonment in Rome) ***Philemon* 22**. Paul acknowledged that prayers of faithful Christian’s may move Jehovah God to act sooner on behalf of our brothers (Heb 13:19).  However , keeping in that our collective prayers is not to pressure Jehovah since he know the conditions of is servants but our prayers to move him to act sooner based on our collective request by earnestly praying to him and leaving matter into his hand
