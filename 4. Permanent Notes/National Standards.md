National standards. These are standards established by countries' regulatory authorities to govern domestic construction policies and practices. Examples are the national building codes (like the Nigerian National Building Code, the Indian Standard Code, the United States Uniform Building Code), and also local forest codes. These national standards often draw from international standard bodies' frameworks but tailor their standards to domestic uses and applications.
