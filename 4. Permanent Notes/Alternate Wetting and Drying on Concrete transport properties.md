Alternate wet and drying affect the transport properties of concrete like water absorption  in concrete. The effect of this condition has been studied by several researcher e.g Ogirigbo & Durojaye, 2020. Ogirigbo & Durojaye, 2020 studied the effect of alternate wet and dry condition on concrete in coastal region like Lagos in which concrete is exposed to variation in temperature and exposure to saline water. Ogirigbo & Durojaye, 2020 study found out that concrete in coastal region exposed to alternate wet and dry condition absorbs water and thereby exhibit low compressive strength as time goes on.
