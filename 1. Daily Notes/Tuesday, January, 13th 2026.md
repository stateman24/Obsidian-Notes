## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Isa 48:17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=23048017&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Jehovah invites us to be his friend, a guest in his tent. Pondering over the psalmist expressions on [Psalms 15](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=19015000-19015005&pub=nwtsty) gives us requirements to be Jehovah’s friend and dwell in his tent. Based on this it only when we become his friend that we can receive loving directions from him as stated in [Isa 48:17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=23048017&pub=nwtsty). The psalmist and [Isa 48:17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=23048017&pub=nwtsty) also revealed that the main aim of Jehovah’s directions is to make us happy and to benefit ourselves. So being Jehovah’s friend is a privilege and a blessing and in the future we will also looking for to the blessings Jehovah have for his friends ([Revelations 21:3,4](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=66021003&pub=nwtsty), [John 14:2](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43014002&pub=nwtsty))

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Acts 18](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44018000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: This account continues to highlight Paul’s second missionary tour. I have come to learn that even as a missionary apostle Paul had a trade that he was doing to sustain himself ([Acts 18: 2,3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44018003&pub=nwtsty)). I also learnt about Apostle Paul’s time Corinth, how Jehovah spirit made to teach and persuade the Jews and the Greeks about Jesus and the Good new. There also an incident where he was accused a brought to the judgement seat in Corinth where he boldly and tactfully gave a witness about Jesus Christ and the Good news ([Acts 18: 12-17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44018012&pub=nwtsty)). ***Note: There is still tons of lessons to be learned from these account***
