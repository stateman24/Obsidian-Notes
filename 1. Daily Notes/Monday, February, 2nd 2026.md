**Lessons**: Apostle Paul highlights that to have God righteousness it is important to have Faith since a righteous person has to live by reasons of Faith ([Rom 1: 16,17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45001017&pub=nwtsty)). He also highlighted that to see God’s invisible qualities we have to look at his creations I.e the birds, the animals, the earth’s ecosystem, the universe at large, these creations show his divine qualities and eternal power and by this we can perceive his righteousness through faith([Rom 1: 20](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45001020&pub=nwtsty))
