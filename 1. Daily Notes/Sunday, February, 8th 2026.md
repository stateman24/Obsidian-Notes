## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [1 Thess 2:2](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=52002002&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: As Christians in this wicked world, we need courage to support God’s Kingdom. It takes courage to live by Jehovah’s standards, it takes courage to preach about God’s kingdom, it take courage to be political neutral. As a result we are and will be persecuted for our stance with God’s kingdom. We can get courage and strength by considering Jesus example of support God’s Kingdom when the Devil pressured him to be involved in the political system of the world ([Matt 4:8-11](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40004008-40004011&pub=nwtsty)). Just like Jesus we can rely on Jehovah for strength and courage. 

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Romans 5](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45005000&pub=nwtsty) 
**Lessons**: It is wonderful to consider how loving Jehovah can be. We can see his love for us in action when let his son die for our sins, Jehovah shows love to use when we were sinners. How much more when we have become reconciled with him by having faith and been declared righteous. It is reassuring to know this because Jehovah’s love for us abounds more for us when we are following is standards. A big example of this is Abraham ([Rom 5:8-10](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45005008&pub=nwtsty)). When we are declared righteous by having faith and we are faced with tribulations, help us develop stronger hope. We know that this is hope will not lead to disappointment because we have hope in God’s love and because of God’s Love as never failed. Because of this we can be happy or rejoice when we are faced with trials or tribulations because our endurance produce an approved condition which results to our strengthened hope ([Rom 5:1-5](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45005001&pub=nwtsty)).
