## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Romans 12:2](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45012002&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: The theme of today text highlight the fact that we need to make our mind over to be transformed by God’s word not by the system of things. This involves using our power of reasoning to find out what we are learning is actually the truth and become convinced it is the truth. This is what parents should help their children to do by show them how they can find answers to their questions in the bible and other publications 

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Acts 20](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44020000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: This account highlights Paul’s journey to Macedonia and other cities along the ways until he reached Troy’s where through Jehovah’s power he performed a miracle by resurrecting a man named Euʹty·chus ([Acts 20: 7-10](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44020007&pub=nwtsty)). I also learnt how Paul addressed the elders of Ephesus, Paul showed steadfastness in the sense that he knew that he might be imprisoned and ridiculed when he gets to Jerusalem but he steadfastly continues bear witness about the good news ([Acts 20: 22-24](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44020022&pub=nwtsty)). This is a good example of steadfastness I want to learn from, so this begs the question: ***How can I show steadfastness in my worship of Jehovah***?
