## To-do List 
- [ ] 

## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [1 Cor 9:26](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=46009026&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: As much as Bible reading is a beneficial, it is more important that I get the best out of my Bible reading by taking time to absorb what I am reading. Taking time to think and meditate is like using the Bible as a mirror to know what sort of person I should be. Avoid speed reading 

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: Romans 2 and 3
**Lessons**: Rom 2: 14,15 highlights the fact the even if we are not trained by the law(for my time God’s world), there a certain law the are in us morally, that help us to distinguish between right and wrong. Consequently, we can distinguish between right and wrong inherently because that is how we are, we have a nature conscience even though untrained by the law but still acts as a moral compass. But it can be skewed if it not trained properly.
