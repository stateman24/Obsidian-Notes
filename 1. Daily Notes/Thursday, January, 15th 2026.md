## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Numbers 16:28](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=04016028&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Today’s text is a very powerful one, It drive a vital lesson about how Jehovah disapproves those who disrespect his organization arrangement in the congregation or organization at large. A good example is Korah and his men when they challenged the position of Moses, inherently challenging Jehovah ([Num 16: 1-3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=04016001-04016003&pub=nwtsty)). The consequences of their actions were dire and all the people associated with them were punished by Jehovah ([Num 16: 30-35](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=04016030-04016035&pub=nwtsty)).
