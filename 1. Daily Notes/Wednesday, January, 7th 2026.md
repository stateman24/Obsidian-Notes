## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: Acts 12
 **Lessons**: Jehovah rescues is faithful ones just like he did for Peter (Acts 12: 7-10). I must give glory to Jehovah for all I have, I don’t want to be like King Herod for being proud and giving glory to himself and he suffered dearly for it (Acts 12: 21-23)
