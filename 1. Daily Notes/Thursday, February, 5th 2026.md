## To-do List 
- [ ] 

## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Matt 6:33](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40006033&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Seeking first God Kingdom involves us considering how our work affects the time we give to pursuing kingdom interests. So it is crucial for us to consider spiritual cost of our jobs to see how we can adjust to pursue kingdom interests.

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Romans 3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45003000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: This passage highlights how observing the law does not mean righteousness rather the law declares us guilty of sin ([Rom 3: 19, 20](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45003019-45003020&pub=nwtsty)). Why?. Because the law highlight some host of actions, attitude and practices as sinful. Based on this fact those under the law are guilty of sin. So what then makes a man righteous?. Paul in the [Rom 3: 28](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45003028&pub=nwtsty) make us to understand that a man is declared righteous by faith not by works of law ()
