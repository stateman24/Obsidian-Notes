**Scripture**: John 6:5
**Theme**: Bread is a common food in bible times. It is so important that the bible use Bread to refer to food generally (Matt 6:11; Acts 20:7). Jesus used beard in one of his miracle when he used 5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes to feed thousands of people ([John Chapter 16](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43006001-43006071&pub=nwtsty)).  It is also important to note that before Jesus performed the miracle he prayed and give thanks before sharing the food ([John 16: 11-13](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43006011-43006013&pub=nwtsty)). This is an important lesson for me in that Jesus set a pattern for me to pray and give thanks to God before any meal since he is the provider of the meal.
