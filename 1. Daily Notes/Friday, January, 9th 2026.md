## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [John 6:5](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43006005&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Bread is a common food in bible times. It is so important that the bible use Bread to refer to food generally (Matt 6:11; Acts 20:7). Jesus used beard in one of his miracle when he used 5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes to feed thousands of people ([John Chapter 6](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43006001-43006071&pub=nwtsty)).  It is also important to note that before Jesus performed the miracle he prayed and give thanks before sharing the food ([John 6: 11-13](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43006011-43006013&pub=nwtsty)). This is an important lesson for me in that Jesus set a pattern for me to pray and give thanks to God before any meal since he is the provider of the meal.
## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Acts 14](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44014000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: The accounts in this passage highlights Paul and Barnabas journey and experience in Iconium after leaving [[Antioch of Pisida]] (Acts 14: 1-5), also in Lystra where Paul healed a crippled man and the crowd began to praise and give worship to Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14: 8-13). But we can see from the accounts Paul and Barnabas did not consider themselves as superior due to the fact that they we blessed with the Holy Spirit ([Acts 14:15-17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44014015-44014017&pub=nwtsty)) instead considering verse 15 carefully, they humbly admitted to having the same weaknesses as their pagan listeners. Like today I should  not consider my self superior to others after all I am human so as them but I should give glory and honor to Jehovah for any ability or accomplishment the I might have just like Paul and Barnabas did. The rest is the account highlights Paul and Barnabas journey to Perga, Attalia proclaiming the good news and encouraging fellow Christians along the way (Acts 14: 21-26). This concludes Paul’s First Missionary tour.
