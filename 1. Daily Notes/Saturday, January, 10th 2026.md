## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Romans 6:23](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45006023&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: We inherited sin from Adam and Eve ([Romans 5 :12](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45005012&pub=nwtsty)), resulting in death. This sin we inherited is like a debt we can pay but can only pay when we die ([Romans 6:7](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45006007&pub=nwtsty)). But Jehovah as given is a gift, the ransom sacrifice of his son Jesus Christ our Lord. This gift is gives everlasting life since to pay the debt of sin we inherited from Adam. 

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Acts 15](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: These passage of the bible highlights on of the key doctrines adopted by the early Christian. And this started when there was and issue of circumcision raised by the Jewish Christians ([Acts 15: 1](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015001&pub=nwtsty)). So to quell this dissension in the congregation Paul and Barnabas was appointed to relate this issues to the apostles in Jerusalem. Based on the issue, and rigorous discussion by the apostles they came to a unanimous decision in [Acts 15: 28-29](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015028-44015029&pub=nwtsty). It is important to know the significance of this decision in terms of the issue about circumcision, based on the fact the Christians are chosen by God through the pouring out of his Holy sprit, in essence becoming people of his name ([Acts 15:14](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015014&pub=nwtsty)). So based on this laws bind the Jews is not in effect for the Christians, the apostle from their decision show Jehovah’s principle that bind all mankind like Jehovah’s view on blood, sexual immorality and so on 
**Fun Fact**: Jame quotes from [Amos 9:11,12 ](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015014&pub=nwtsty)when he was speaking in [Acts 15:16](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44015016&pub=nwtsty). The point of the quote is to highlight the fulfillment of the prophecy in that account through Jesus Christ and the people from all the nations I.e Christians
