## To-do List 
- [ ] 

## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Prov 20:3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=20020003&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Being reasonable is beautiful quality to have. It is quality that promotes peace in the congregation. Being reasonable allows us to be able to listen to others an be open to their viewpoint. Reasonableness allow us to be able to value other advices ([Prov 15:22](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=20015022&pub=nwtsty)). How can I be more reasonable with my dealings with others?. One way to show reasonableness is to take the initiative to make peace. ([Matt 5:23, 24](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40005023&pub=nwtsty))

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: Acts 1 - 28, [Intro the book of Romans](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&docid=1001070049) 
**Lessons**: As I read the books of Roman, I want to answer the following questions
- How God is impartial with his dealings with people 
- How Christians can be peaceable with other 
- How freedom from seen comes from exercising faith in Jesus.
The main theme of the book for Romans is Christian Righteousness and that the result of righteousness comes from faith in Jesus Christ ([Romans 1: 16, 17](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=45001016-45001017&pub=nwtsty))
