## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: Rom 12:21
**Theme**: We should show patience when faced with injustice, especially when it comes from our fellow brothers. We should understand we cannot do without injustice and we should not be surprised when we are victim of one (Eccl. 5:8). To show that we are conquering evil with good when we are faced with injustice is that we need to show patience to our opposers. So if we can show patience to our opposers how much more our fellow brothers, also having the understanding that they imperfect we help us to show patience 

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: Acts 13
**Lessons**: This account talks about Paul and Barnabas first missionary tour, relating the experience of Paul in Paphos in Cyprus how Paul filled with Holy Spirit made a man named Bar-Jesus to a believer (Acts 13: 6-12). I also learnt how Paul courageous and articulately address the people in the synagogue in [[Antioch of Pisida]] quoting psalms (Acts 13:33, Ps 2:7, Pa 16:10, Acts 13: 35) and verses from the scriptures to the people of the synagogue and they became believers
