**Scripture**: [Psalms 144:1](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=19144001&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: If I make Jehovah my rock I will be stable spiritually and mentally because as I grow in my Faith in him and spirituality that will make me not to be  indecisive, unsteady, or easily swayed by false teachings and worldly thinking. ([Eph. 4:14](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=49004014&pub=nwtsty); [Jas. 1:6-8](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=59001006-59001008&pub=nwtsty)). This is very important that for me because I live in a world rule by Satan and subtle mental attack he uses such as exposing me to worldly thinkings that may look and sound logic or reasonable but are not based on the accurate knowledge of the bible can will definitely bring doubts to my faith in Jehovah. In such case it is vital I filter and reduce my exposure to such thinkings.
