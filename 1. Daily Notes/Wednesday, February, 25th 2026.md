**Scripture**: [1 Corinthians 10:12](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=46010012&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Today’s text is a reminder that we may overcome some imperfect tendencies (i.e. bad habits) over time, we can find ourselves plagued with the tendency again if we are not on guarded. A good example of Apostle Peter, he let fear of man overcome him when he denied Jesus 3 times ([Matt 26:69-75](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40026069-40026075&pub=nwtsty)). He later overcame this when he boldly gave a witness of Jesus before the Sahendrin ([Acts 5:27-29](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44005027-44005029&pub=nwtsty)) . This fear resurfaced when he stopped eating with the Gentile Christians due to his fear of the circumcised Christian class. Overcoming a bad habit or some imperfect tendencies is not enough, we need to continue to avoid situations the might result in to temptations that will make us go back to our imperfect tendencies. That is why applying Jesus counsel in [Matt 26:41](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40026041&pub=nwtsty) is important.
