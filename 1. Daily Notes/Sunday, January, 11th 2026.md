## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [John 17:26](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=43017026&pub=nwtsty)
**Theme**: Jesus made Jehovah’s name know by sharing the true about God’s kingdom on earth. Similarly for us Christians today it is privilege to have a share in sharing the true about God kingdom and our aim just like Jesus is to plant and water seeds of Kingdom truth in the hearts of people ([Matt 13:3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40013003&pub=nwtsty), [23](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=40013023&pub=nwtsty), [1 Cor 3:6-8](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=46003006&pub=nwtsty)).  But this privilege is not open for anyone because Jesus did not allow wicked spirits to manifest on his behalf ([Luke 4: 41](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=42004041&pub=nwtsty)). In essence one has to be qualified to be able to share in this privilege i.e dedicate one life to Jehovah. Jehovah’s organization has worked in line with what Jesus did by making know Jehovah’s name and sharing the true about his kingdom.  For example, New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures has played a significant role in this by restoring God’s name to its rightful place.

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**: [Acts 16](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44016000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: This account highlights Paul’s second part of Paul’s second missionary tour in which they traveled from Derbe to Lystra where they met Timothy (Acts 16: 1). The Holy Spirit moved and directed Paul and Silas in their journey and one of the place they go to was the city of Macedonia. That is where they meet Lydia ([Acts 16: 14-15](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44016014&pub=nwtsty)). They also has an encounter with a girl possessed by demons following Paul and Silas declaring that where servant of the Most High God, in which prompted Paul to cast out the demons in her ([Acts 16:16-18](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44016016&pub=nwtsty)), this incident highlights the fact the demons and wicked have no place or power to manifest or proclaim Jehovah’s name, likewise of us humans, we have to earn the privilege. Paul’s actions lead to a series of event that landed them in to prison from the passage we can see how Jehovah acted on their behave when they began praying and singing praises to Jehovah ([Acts 16: 25-30](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44016025-44016031&pub=nwtsty)). There are two important lessons here 
1. Jehovah acts on behalf of his faithful ones just like he did for Paul and Silas 
2. Praying and giving praises to Jehovah no matter the situation we find ourselves is important, not only will it help us to focus but will prompt Jehovah to act on our behalf to change our situation.
