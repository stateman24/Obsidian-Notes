## Daily Text 
**Scripture**: [Acts 13: 22](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44013022&pub=nwtsty) 
**Theme**: David is a fine example we can imitate when it come to how we can improve our relationship with Jehovah. Despite personal failing and trials, David remained loyal to Jehovah and he continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes ([1 Kings 15:5](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=11015005&pub=nwtsty)). How can I imitate David?. By pondering over David’s words to his son Solomon in [1 King 2:2,3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=11002002&pub=nwtsty). By doing what is right in Jehovah’s eyes and obeying is righteous standards for example reading the Bible daily, sharing the good news with other, showing love to others among others will I be some one agreeable to Jehovah’s heart just like David.

## Bible Reading 
**Portion**:  [Acts 21](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44021000&pub=nwtsty)
**Lessons**: I want to imitate Paul’s flexibility when he was confronted with a rumor that was distorted by the elders in Jerusalem ([Acts 21:21](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44021021&pub=nwtsty)), instead of Paul to be defensive and try to correct the distorted rumor, Paul with the aim of harmony did as the elders instructed to quail the issue ([Acts 21: 24-26](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=44021026&pub=nwtsty)). What can I learn from this?, If I am wrongfully accused how should I handle the situation?. Just like Paul I want to first of all understand the situation with calmness and be flexible in my dealings with my accusers.
