### Fineness of Cement 
The fineness of cement refers to the particle size distribution of the powder and has a direct impact on the speed of hydration, the rate of strength development, and the ultimate strength of the hardened concrete. In order to produce high-quality concrete, it is essential to use cement with the proper fineness.

### Implication of fineness of Cement in Concrete
1. It affect the rate of hydration of cement.
2. Since it increases the rate of hydration this result to increase in strength gain.
3. It improves the workability of concrete and also increases the setting time of concrete 
4. Fineness of cement reduces bleeding in concrete and also increases dry shrinkage of concrete

### Pozzolans
Pozzolans are aluminous and siliceous  materials in which they themselves possess little to no cementitious properties but in finely divided form react with Calcium Hydroxide in the presence of water to form compound that possesses cementitious properties.
