> 📓Do not let the sun set while you are still angry.​—Eph. 4:26.
> 

Love is the basis for trust. Jehovah is patient with us even when we sin against him. Certainly, then, we can be patient with our brothers if they say or do things that irritate or hurt us. Verse 5 adds: “[Love] does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.” We would not want to make a mental record of our brothers’ offenses for future reference.Instead of focusing on their faults, look for their fine qualities

1. Training slow brain by exposing it to challenges so as to attain pattern recognition which allows the fast brain to work efficiently 
2. The rubber duck method. This is a method whereby I explain my solution out loud so as to know my line of thought properly and find clarity. It also helps in conveying my thoughts process in a simple manner which can help when I am stuck
3. The 10 minutes Primer Method. This is just taking 10 minutes to know the overview of what the challenge involves and it prepares the mind on how to go about the problem.
4. The Lighthouse method. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller problems by reducing the inputs or solving for small version of the challenge and then build on that solution This method allows the brain to approach problems systematically i.e., step by step, and using this method it creates a mini checkpoints which builds momentum
