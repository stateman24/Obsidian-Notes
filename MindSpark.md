 # Project Idea
This a Quiz app in which the user will be able to take quizzes in a fun and engaging manner. The user should be able to create new quizzes for personal or for others. The User should be able to invite other to engage in the quiz they have created. The app will contain a default set of questions an specific field and the quizzes will have difficulty level ranging from Easy to Hard. Since the app will be engaging User will have an exp reward and let the level up based on the number of question and quizzes attempted. 

# ***Phase 1:*** Project Requirements
## Functionalities
- User Authentication 
- User should be able take quizzes
- User should be able to create quizzes 
- User should be able to edit their profile 
- User should be able to Invite other people to quizzes created by the users 
- The application will contain a leveling system which is based on **exp**

## Other Important Functionalities

# ***Phase 3***: Development Phase
## Development Roadmap
---
### **Phase 1:  Project Setup and Core Foundation** 

1. **Set Up the Development Environment:**
   - Initialize a new Django project.
   - Set up `PostgreSQL` for your database.
   - Install and configure `Tailwind CSS` for styling.
   - Set up JavaScript integration (vanilla or a framework if necessary).
   - Set up Redis for caching (to use later).
   - Set up Celery for asynchronous tasks.

2. **Core Settings and Dependencies:**
   - Configure Django settings (database, static files, etc.).
   - Install necessary packages (`django-allauth` for authentication, `django-celery` for background tasks, `whitenoise` for static files).
   - Create basic models (User, Quiz, Question, etc.).
---
### **Phase 2: User Authentication**

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Implement user sign-up and login functionality using Django’s authentication system.
   - Set up email verification with Django’s built-in email support.
   - Create password reset functionality.

2. **Social Authentication:**
   - Optionally integrate social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) for quicker user onboarding.

3. **User Profile Management:**
   - Allow users to view and edit their profile (name, avatar, etc.).
   - Create a profile page where users can view their details and quiz history.
---
### **Phase 3: Quiz Creation and Management**

1. **Create Quizzes:**
   - Build forms for users to create quizzes, with options for adding multiple-choice questions, specifying correct answers, etc.
   - Implement functionality to store quiz data (questions, options, correct answers) in the database.
   - Add validation to ensure quizzes are well-formed (at least one question, valid answers, etc.).

2. **Quiz Management:**
   - Allow users to edit and update quizzes they’ve created.
   - Implement functionality to delete quizzes.

3. **Invite Others to Take a Quiz:**
   - Allow users to share or invite other users via email or link.
   - Generate unique shareable URLs for each quiz.
   - Track who was invited and their progress on the quiz.
---
### **Phase 4: Taking Quizzes**

1. **Quiz Interface for Users:**
   - Create the quiz-taking interface for users with multiple-choice questions.
   - Handle quiz submission and real-time scoring.
   - Implement a timer for quizzes that have time limits.

2. **Asynchronous Score Calculation (Celery):**
   - Use Celery for asynchronous score calculation and leaderboard updates to avoid slowing down the user experience.
   - Store quiz results and display them after the quiz.

3. **Quiz Result Review:**
   - Allow users to review their quiz results (correct/incorrect answers, score).
   - Display summary information (e.g., percentage correct, time taken).
---
### **Phase 5: Leveling System and Gamification**

1. **Leveling System:**
   - Create an **EXP** system where users earn points for completing quizzes.
   - Set up levels based on cumulative experience points (XP).
   - Show user progress towards the next level on their profile/dashboard.

2. **Badges and Achievements (Optional):**
   - Create badges or achievements for specific actions (e.g., completing 10 quizzes, getting 100% on a quiz).
   - Display badges on the user’s profile.
---
### **Phase 6: Caching and Performance Optimization**

1. **Implement Caching with Redis:**
   - Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., quiz questions, results, leaderboard).
   - Use Redis to cache data that doesn’t change often (e.g., user levels, quiz content).

2. **Optimize Database Queries:**
   - Use Django’s query optimization techniques (e.g., `select_related`, `prefetch_related`) to reduce database hits.
   - Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., user IDs, quiz IDs).
---
### **Phase 7: Asynchronous Tasks**

1. **Background Tasks (Celery):**
   - Use Celery for sending quiz invitation emails.
   - Run scheduled leaderboard updates in the background.
   - Perform data aggregation tasks (e.g., quiz statistics, user progress) asynchronously.

2. **Notifications:**
   - Implement real-time notifications (via Django Channels or WebSockets) for quiz invites, results, and leaderboard updates.
---
### **Phase 8: Security**

1. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Implement CSRF protection and secure cookies.
   - Set up rate limiting (to avoid abuse, especially for quiz attempts).
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt communication.
   - Protect quiz data (especially results and leaderboard) from unauthorized access.

2. **User Data Privacy:**
   - Implement privacy settings for users (e.g., make quizzes public or private).
   - Ensure password encryption and follow best practices for storing sensitive information.
---
### **Phase 9: User Dashboard and Analytics**

1. **User Dashboard:**
   - Create a dashboard where users can see their quiz stats (number of quizzes taken, score history, XP progress).
   - Display leaderboard information (global rankings or friends’ rankings).
   - Show users a summary of their achievements and badges.

2. **Quiz Analytics:**
   - Provide quiz creators with analytics on their quizzes (number of participants, average score, time spent, etc.).
---
### **Phase 10: Responsive Design and Web Motion**

1. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the entire app is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS.
   - Test across multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) for consistent experience.

2. **Web Motion and Animations:**
   - Add interactive animations for buttons, quiz transitions, and user feedback.
   - Use subtle CSS animations to enhance the user experience and give a fun vibe.
---
### **Phase 11: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Automated Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your models, views, and serializers.
   - Write functional and integration tests to ensure everything works together.
   
2. **Manual Testing:**
   - Perform manual testing on various devices and browsers.
   - Ensure that the performance is optimal and no major bugs exist.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Set up the app for deployment using services like **Heroku** or **DigitalOcean**.
   - Ensure proper environment configurations (e.g., `DEBUG=False`, security settings).
   - Use a task queue (e.g., Celery) and configure your Redis server for caching and background tasks.
---
### **Optional Enhancements:**

1. **Admin Panel for Quiz Management:**
   - Create an admin panel where admins can monitor quizzes, users, and stats.

2. **Multiplayer or Timed Competitions (Future Feature):**
   - Consider adding real-time quiz competitions where users can compete against each other.

---
### Final Tips:

- **Iterate:** Start with a minimal version of each feature and then improve it over time.
- **Testing:** Don’t forget to continuously test as you go, both with automated tests and manually, to ensure that each new feature works as expected.
- **Documentation:** Keep your code well-documented, and make sure your README is updated to help future collaborators or your own understanding later.

By breaking down the development into these manageable phases, you can maintain focus on each aspect of the app while ensuring a smooth, structured process!
