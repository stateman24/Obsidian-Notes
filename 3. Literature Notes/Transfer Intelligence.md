____
- Create a mental model on how concepts work and how they can be related to other fields
> **Daily Practice**: 20 min of learning a concept outside my field. Then ask `How does this concept change how I think in my main area`. 

Adaptive problem solving it all involves 
- Solving problems without templates 
- Explaining ideas in new context
- Experiment and adjusting 
It involves perspective switching on an idea which means changing the context at which an idea works initially 

It is important to ***`iterate`*** not ***`collect`*** 
Which means 
**`learn -> apply -> reflect -> adapt`**
