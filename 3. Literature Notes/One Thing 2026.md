*How much progress will make by focusing on one strategic thing for an entire year?*
The speaker discusses on how important and profound it is to focus on one thing for the entire year 

> ***Many people don’t fail because they dream too little but they fail because the dream too much at once*** 

The main goal is to have a 
- Strategic Direction - To have a clear focused path to reach a goal
- Focused Execution - Daily actions that compound to reach the desired goal
Why to most new year resolution fail? 
- To many competing goals
- No systematic Approach 
- Motivation fades quickly 
- Willpower is a limited resource 
- Life distractions always wins

> ***Performances rise not with too many goals but with a fewer better chosen goals***

That one goal has to have a concrete focus, one clear target and a measurable outcome 

***What would I do in 2026 if it is impossible for me to fail?***

### The 5 Filter Framework 
- **Change Trajectory** - How does the goal change the course of my life?, Does it fundamentally change the my future path?
- **Create Leverage** - Will success here make everything else easier? 
- **Sacrifice** - Does it demand me to give something up?
- **Trigger Domino Effect** - Will other wins naturally follow?
- **Show Progress in 90 day** - Can I measure meaningful progress quickly? 

>  Dream needs structure. Strategy bridges intentions and outcome 

### Strategic Planning Model
- Vision - See the Destination 
- Focus - Eliminate distractions 
- Action - Execution relentlessly 

### End of the year Visualization 
- What will be true about my life by the end of the year
- What becomes easier 
- What problem disappear 
- Who would I have become 

### Necessary Strategic Pillar
- Skills Required 
- Network & Mentors 
- System & Tools 
- Financial & Time Resource
