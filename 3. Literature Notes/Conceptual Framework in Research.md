A conceptual framework makes the case for why a study is significant and relevant and how the study design appropriately and rigorously answers the research questions.

**Components of a Conceptual Framework**
- The major role of conceptual framework include arguing for the significance of a research topic.
- It helps to ground the topic in it multiple contexts(theoretical and actual)
-  It also guides the development and iteration of research questions
- It also influences the methods within a methodological framework that makes sense for the topic
- It also provides the researcher with a framework and set of contexts in which you can examine your social positionality as they relate to and shape the research process, including the overall methodology and specific methods of choices.
- It serves as a connective tissue of a research study in that it helps you integrate your understanding of the various influences on and aspect of a specific research study

**Roles and Uses of a Conceptual Framework**
There are lots of roles and uses of concetual framework, which include:
- Providing the overall structure in which you can articulate and examine the goals of your study and its intended audiences
- Serving as a compass for identifying the relevance and selection of, and then engaging with and integrating across, existing research literature and theories
- Providing the idea context for you to argue for the rationale and significance of your study for/to its intended areas, fields, and/or disciplines
- Providing a dynamic system for identifying and refining your understanding of your researcher positionality and engaging in a reflexive approach to your study
- Helping to direct you toward your methodological orientation and approach (e.g., critical race theory)
- Helping you develop an appropriate framework for the collection of data and the development of instruments
- Serving as a guide and frame for the selection of data analysis frameworks and processes.
- Acting as a foundation for writing and critically scrutinizing your analysis and study findings.

Conceptual framework helps the researcher recognize and assert how the aspects of research content and process influence, as they are influenced by, the guiding conceptual linkages in a given study. One way to think across these various roles and functions of a conceptual framework is to consider the notion of situating a study in its multiple intersecting, ever-iterating contexts and concepts.
