There are examples of caregivers in the bible, for example Abraham and Sarah took care of Terah especially when they where on the road ([Gen 11: 31, 32](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=01011031-01011032&pub=nwtsty)), during which Terah was over 200 years old. It must have been hard to since they will travel on camels and donkeys which which will be hard for an old man 

Joy can help caregivers persevere ([Prov 15:13](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=20015013&pub=nwtsty), [James 1: 2, 3](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=59001002&pub=nwtsty)). Getting the joy involves relying on Jehovah in prayer asking him for help to keep a positive attitude.

### How can caregiving affect our Joy
- Caregivers may experience burnout: Due to constant work to take care of loved one, caregivers can be emotionally and physically drained as a result they may feel lonely and trapped by their circumstance.
- Caregivers may battle intense feelings of guilt or grief
- At times caregivers make feel they are taken for granted. This may be due to the fact they are rarely appreciated or commended for their hard work. 

### How to remain Joyful as a Caregiver 
- Being Modest when we know our limit and we are ready to accept help. [Prov 11:2](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=20011002&pub=nwtsty) 
- Being discerning will allow caregivers to be calm when provoked ([Prov 19:11](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=20019011&pub=nwtsty)). It is important because discernment will help caregivers to try and understand and comprehend the situation of ones they are taking care of. So it always good research on the illness of the one we are taking care of.
- Find the time to strengthen friendship with Jehovah is equally important to remain joyful as a caregiver. Imitating the example of David can be of help especially in [Psalms 132: 4, 5](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=19132004-19132005&pub=nwtsty). As a caregiver, spare time is usually a luxury due to busy schedules but we are urged to find time for the most important things such as our relationship with Jehovah ([Philippians 1:10](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=50001010&pub=nwtsty))
- As a caregiver, it is important to find time to take care of one’s health. Having a good rest, exercising and having a good diet can can go a long way 
- Maintaining a good sense of humor will protect caregiver’s mental health ([Proverbs 17:22](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=50001010&pub=nwtsty))
- Talking to a trusted friend 
- Meditate on the future hope of eternal life with the ones being taken care of. Imagining them in good health condition can help caregivers keep their joy. Some of those hope are in [Isaiah 33:24](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=23033024&pub=nwtsty), [65:21](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=23065021&pub=nwtsty) among other promises in the bible.
### How can others help caregivers?
- By helping caregivers get sometimes for themselves by making ourselves available to assist them. The account in [Galatians 6:2](https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=jwlshare&wtlocale=E&prefer=lang&bible=48006002&pub=nwtsty) urges us to carry the burden of one another, we can do this by show up to help caregivers have time for themselves as well.
- By helping them in congregation meetings. we can offer to help by sitting with the caregiver’s loved one during some of these meetings or a portion of them. If the person in need is housebound, you could offer to go to his home and tie in to a meeting with him so that the caregiver can attend the meeting in person
- Commend them and pray for them[^1]
