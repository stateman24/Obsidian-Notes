### **Step 1: Define the Problem**

**Hypothesis:**  
_Small/mid-sized construction firms in Nigeria struggle with material waste, project delays, and miscommunication due to manual tracking (paper/Excel) and disjointed tools (WhatsApp, calls)._

**Validate by asking professionals:**

1. _“How do you currently track materials on-site?”_
    - Expected pain points: Miscounts, theft, time wasted on manual logs.
2. _“How do you communicate tasks with artisans/clients?”_
    - Expected pain points: Lost messages, no records, miscommunication.
3. _“What’s the biggest hassle in your daily site management?”_

**Target interviewees:**
- Site engineers
- Contractors
- Artisan foremen (masons, electricians)

### **Step 2: Refine Your Solution**

**Your proposed solution:**  
_A mobile-friendly tool that combines:_

1. **QR-based material tracking** → Reduce errors/theft.
2. **Voice-to-text site notes** → Replace paper scribbles.
3. **Task assignment + client updates** → Centralize WhatsApp/Excel chaos.
    

**Feedback questions for validation:**
1. _“Would QR codes for cement/block tracking save you time?”_
2. _“Would you use voice notes to log issues if it auto-saved to a report?”_
3. _“What’s the ONE feature you’d pay for in such a tool?”_

### **Step 3: Competitive Edge**
**Why your solution stands out:**
- **Localized**: Offline mode, Nigerian pricing, multilingual support (e.g., Yoruba/Hausa voice notes).
- **Artisan-friendly**: Simpler than Procore/Raken (no complex workflows).
- **Integrations**: WhatsApp export (since everyone uses it).

**Ask competitors’ users:**  
_“What do you hate about [Raken/Excel]? What’s missing?”_

---
### **Step 4: Prototype & Feedback Loop**

1. **Mockup a demo** (use Figma/Framer):
    - Show QR scanning → inventory update → auto-alert flow.
    - Demo voice note → task assignment.
2. **Share with 5+ professionals** and ask:
    - _“Would this solve your problems? What’s confusing/missing?”_

### **Step 5: Prioritize MVP Features**
Based on feedback, rank features:
1. **Must-have**: QR inventory + low-stock alerts.
2. **Nice-to-have**: Voice notes, WhatsApp sync.
3. **Future**: AI cost estimation, supplier marketPlace.
