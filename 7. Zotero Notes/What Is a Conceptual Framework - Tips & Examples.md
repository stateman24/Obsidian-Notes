- A Conceptual Framework is a representation of the relationship you want to expect to see between your variable or the properties the you want to study and it is generally developed based on literature review

This article highlights several steps to create a conceptual framework for your research.

1. Choose your research question
2. Select you independent and dependent variable
3. Visualize your cause-and-effect relationship
4. Identify other influencing variables

**Choose your Research Question**

- Research questions should guide your work by determining what you want to find out.
- For example, [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z9956HBZ?page=undefined&annotation=undefined) “Let’s say you want to study whether students who study more hours get higher exam scores. To investigate this question, you can use methods such as an experiment or a survey to test the relationship between variables.” ([Swaen, 2022](zotero://select/library/items/2JDXFVRV))
- But before collecting data, conceptual framework must be constructed.

**Select your independent and dependent variables**

- This stage involves identify at least two variables Independent and dependent variables.
- These variables are the expected cause and expected effect of the research and the hypothesis will be based on this variables

**Visualize your cause-and-effect relationship**

- Once the research question and variables have been Identified, the first step is construct the conceptual framework is to visualize the expected cause and effect relationship

I**dentify other influencing variables**

- Along the way identify other variables that can influence the relationship between your variables i.e independent and dependent variable
- An example of this variables is Moderation variables. This alter he effect of the independent variable has on a dependent variable
