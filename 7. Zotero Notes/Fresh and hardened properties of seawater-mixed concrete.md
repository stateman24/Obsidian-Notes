- **Abstract**

- This paper want to look at the fresh and hardened properties of freshwater and seawater mixed concretes.
- So this paper is basically testing of
    
    1. Fresh concrete properties i.e slump flow, density, air content, setting time
    2. Strength of harden Concrete i.e compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and shrinkage
    3. Durablilty of the concrete i.e rapid chloride permeability, chloride migration and water absorption

**Materials**

- Chemical test were done on the mixing water, which include
    
    1. determination of chlorides and sulfates
    2. determination of alkalinity
    3. pH
- These test done using BS standards
    
    - BS 1377-3:2018+A1:2021
    - BS 6068-2.51
- The study made use of two concrete Mixes A and B
- Mix A represents the convention concrete mixed with freshwater and is consider as the control
- Mix B is made with the use of seawater

**Methods**

- Two curing conditions we done
    1. Standard Curing
    2. Seawater Curing
- For permeability performance of hardened concrete
        - rapid chloride permeability test
    - chloride migration test
    - water absoption test
- Isothermal calorimetry
- Micro structure investigation using Scanning electon microcopy (SEM)

### Annotations

>This paper reports on the results of an extensive experimental study to compare the fresh and hardened properties of freshwater- and seawater-mixed concretes. The experimental program included the following tests: (a) characterization of fresh concrete (slump flow, density, yield, air content, and setting time); (b) mechanical characterization of hardened concrete (compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and shrinkage); and (c) permeability performance of hardened concrete (rapid chloride permeability, chloride migration, and water absorption).

**Comment**: The areas this paper is focusing and the point of this study

>The slump test was used as a measure of workability. The density, yield, and air content were measured for fresh concrete, along with the initial setting time of the corresponding mortar. The following standards were adopted: (a) ASTM C143/C143M [51] for the slump flow test; (b) ASTM C138/C138M [52] for the density, yield and air content; and (c) ASTM C403/C403M [53] for the setting time test.

**Comment**: The Method used to test for fresh concrete and the standard used

>Samples were tested to investigate the effect of three variables: (i) mixing water (seawater/freshwater); (ii) testing age (3, 7, 28, and 56 days); and (iii) curing condition (CC/SW).

**Comment**: This are the variable the test aimed to get their effects

>Hence, these permeability tests provide indications about the quality of hardened seawater-mixed concrete and its resistance to chemical attack.

**Comment**: This I use as the base to test for durabilty in terms of chemical resitance

>As suggested by Kaushik and Islam [8], the higher early-age strength of seawater concrete can be attributed to lower  porosity because of the acceleration in the hydration, while the lower long-term strength could be due to the leaching of hydration products. Wegian [21], however, suggested that the lower longterm strength of seawater concrete could be due to salt crystallization in concrete.

**Comment**: Reason why seawater concrete have higher early-age strength

>eawater curing led to a slight increase in the tensile and compressive strength for both concrete mixtures at early ages. However, at 28-day age and later, seawater curing led to a slight negative effect on the mechanical properties of Mix A but to almost no effect on those of Mix B, suggesting that seawater-mixed concrete could show good performance in marine conditions.

**Comment**: Result of the curing

>This can be attributed to the general improvement in concrete properties due to the ongoing hydration of cement. Also, the measurements obtained for Mixes A and B are comparable, indicating an insignificant effect of using seawater on the permeability performance of hardened concrete.

**Comment**: The result of the permeabilty test

>Given that the cumulative heat release is a direct indicator of the cement hydration and thus of the attained compressive strength, these results validate the higher early strength measured in seawater concrete as compared to that of the freshwater-mixed counterpart (Fig. 2-a).

**Comment**: So this the point of the Isothermal calorimety to see the fresh concrete properties of the mixes to get which on have the higher early strengh
