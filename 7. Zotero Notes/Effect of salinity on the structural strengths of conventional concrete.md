### Annotations

>The design mix ratio was determined by volume and the proportions used for in this study are 346.50 kg/m3, 571.73 kg/m3, 1334 kg/m3 and 173.25 kg/m3 for cement, sand, granite and water respectively with a w/c ratio of 0.50 for a Grade 30 concrete.

**Comment**: Design mix of the study

>Also, physio-chemical laboratory analysis was carried on lagoon water obtained at University of Lagos lagoon front (6°31’ 29”N, 3°24’ 8.19”E) to obtained the mass of total dissolved salts present.

**Comment**: I need to do this for my project as well

>Modified Regression Approach.

**Comment**: It is important I look into this because I might need it

>Figure 3 shows that the compressive strength of concrete increased with increase in the curing age. Also, a decline in strength of concrete was observed in different curing medium when compared with the control (potable water).

**Comment**: The overall effect on compressive strength based on the curing medium

>High chloride and sulphate contents would lead to

**Comment**: 

>chloride and sulphate attacks on the concrete specimens. The ingress of these harmful chemical substances would result in crack formation, bond reduction and lower strength due to the chemical reaction produced from these deleterious chemicals. Similar trends were observed when compared with the past record of findings of previous study

**Comment**: Reason for the decrease in compressive strength

>a The combination of some compounds like calcium, magnesium, iron, sulphate, chloride and potassium values which were more than 2000 mg/L in the lagoon water rendered it not suitable for concrete curing. The high concentrations of these substances resulted in the reduction of structural strengths of concrete. b Increase in the curing age resulted in increase in the structural strengths (Compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths) of concrete irrespective of the curing medium. The increase in the concentrations of chloride contents led to increase in the structural strengths of concrete cured in salt water I; but further increase resulted in a lower strength parameter for samples cured in salt water II. c The decline in strengths were as a result of the high concentrations of chloride, sulphate and magnesium contents found in the curing medium (lagoon water, salt water I and II). d Models for predicting the structural strengths of concrete cured in different curing medium were developed through modified regression approach and found to be in good agreement with the experimental data with high level of significance.

**Comment**: This the conclusion derived from the study
