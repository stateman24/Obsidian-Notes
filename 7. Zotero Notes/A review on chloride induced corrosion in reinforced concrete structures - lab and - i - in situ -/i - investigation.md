- **Abstract**

- Reinforced concrete are threatened by chloride-induced corrosion
- This study is a review of on tests an studies on chloride induced corrosion in RC
- NDT approaches, chloride profiling and half cell potential are test reviewed in this study

**Major Effects of corrosion of Reinforcement to RC**

- Rebar loss in strength and ductility
- Cracking in concrete cover
- Bond deterioration at the steel concrete interface as a result of concrete cover loss
- Load carrying capacity of corroded rebar compromised

**Corrosion in RC**

There two phases of corrosion in the life span of RC by Tuutti.

- Initiation Stage in which aggressive agents lie CO2 or chloride penetrate the concrete reach the rebar
- Propagation Period which is the second stage when the corrosion reaches critical level and starts to spread rapidly causing significant structural damage

**How does corrosion Happens**

- It is basically the electrochemical process of reduction of oxygen into hydroxyl ion at the surface of the steel
- This all depend on pH and available oxygen close to the steel surface
- According to studies the main facto influencing whether steel is corrosive is pH
- Steel reinforcement corrodes when two distinct materials react with the environment (such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.) and produce oxides and hydroxides consequently.

**Physical Methods of detecting Corrosion in Concrete**

- Electromagnetic method: It is NDT test that make use of the magnetic properties of Iron oxides, concrete and other to detect corrosion
- 3D laser scanning
- X-ray micro-computed tomography
- Electrochemical method:
    
    1. Electrochamical impedance spectrum (EIS)
    2. the half-cell potential method
    3. Polarization curve method
- Electrical resistivity method

**Conclusion**

- The rate of corrosion varied depending on temperature of the concrete and the availability of oxygen

### Annotations

>chloride penetration and/or concrete carbonation

**Comment**: To causes of corrossion of reinforcement

>Steel corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) structures not only reduces the bond capacity but also alters its behavior based on factors like bond-slip characteristics in the uncorroded state.

**Comment**: Reduction in the bonding between concrete an reinforcement

>The spalling or cracking of the concrete cover because of corrosion isn't just a structural durability issue—it directly affects the mechanical performance of the corroded steel

**Comment**: Secondary effect of cracking or CC loss to the RC

>Researchers have devised several detection techniques to measure the degree of corrosion on steel rebar in concrete. Various quantities are determined to indicate the corrosion state using different methodologies. For instance, the polarization resistance technique is typically used to measure the instantaneous corrosion rate. On the other hand, physical techniques like electromagnetic and electrical resistance measurements, 3D laser scanning, and X-ray micro-computed tomography can be used to characterize the accumulated degree of corrosion.

**Comment**: Some method derived by researchers to measure the degree of corrosion

>Although corrosion rates can increase due to cracking and spalling in concrete, they can also decrease when corrosion products ll the pores of the cracked concrete. The degree of degradation, therefore, is not linear.10 To improve the precision of service life prediction, models that incorporate electrochemical and transport processes are crucial.

**Comment**: An interesting insight on corrosion

>Chloride can inltrate reinforced concrete through many pathways, such as construction water or materials that are polluted. It can also disperse from the surroundings, especially in marine regions with alternating wet and dry periods, or because of the use of de-icing salts in winter, such as CaCl2, MgCl2, and NaCl.1

**Comment**: How chlorides gets into concrete

>To decrease the overall porosity, it is advisable to employ a low water-to-cement ratio (0.4–0.5) during the rst stage extension

**Comment**: Relashionship between concrete porosity and water-cement ratio

>In addition, an elevated concentration of chloride ions can lead to chemical reactions with other substances, such as tri-calcium aluminate (C3A), resulting in the formation of Friedel's salt.

**Comment**: The part of concrete chloride ion really reacts with

>High calcium and alumina content SCMs may also affect the resilience of RC by reducing the ingression of Cl− to the rebar and inuencing the chloride binding capacity.

**Comment**: This is where SCMs like fly ash and the rest comes in

>According to British level BS 5328-1,24 the allowed range for the overall percentage of chloride ions in cement is between 0.1% to 0.4% by mass, depending on the specic quality level that the cement meets

**Comment**: The allowable percentage of concrete ion in concrete according to BS 5328

>The observed RC specimen experiences a drop in the cross-sectional area of steel and a shi in magnetic ux lines corresponding to the formation of corrosion products when subjected to an electromagnet-generated magnetic eld. The strength of the magnetic eld is detected and measured using Hall-effect sensors.

**Comment**: How EM detects corrosion in concrete

>Applying the same concept, EM non-destructive technology is also used to nd steel rebar in concrete and measure the amount of water in fresh concrete

**Comment**: Other application of EM method

>By analyzing 3D scanning data, it can accurately determine the change in crosssectional area, distribution of pit depths, and the overall volume or mass loss of steel in rebar. This enables the establishment of the “corrosion level” by considering other criteria such as the depth of pits, the geometry of pitting, and the probability distribution of the loss of cross-sectional are

**Comment**: How 3D laser scanning is used to detect corrosion

>The foundation of the X-ray mCT technology lies in the fact that various materials possess varying capacities for X-ray adsorption. Based on the makeup of the penetrating materials, the X-ray beam's intensity attenuates to differing degrees when it passes through an RC sample as detected by a detector. Corrosion products, steel rebar, concrete aws (pores, voids, and fractures), and cementitious components, may all be recognized and discriminated against, according to research.
