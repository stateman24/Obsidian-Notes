- **Abstract**

- The point of this paper is to investigate the infulence of using enviromental by product (silica fume and fly ash)
- The study parameters include slump, air content, unit weight, compressive strenght, tensile strenght, flexural strength, static Young’s modulus and dynamic elastic modulus.

**Materials used in this study**

- Ordinary Portland Cement
- Silica fume
- Fly ash
- Chemical Admixture e.g HP super plasticizer, HR water reducing admixture, air entraining agent

**Method used in the study**

- The research is carried by using the there materials together to form a ternary cementitious system.
- The test conducted on the hardened concrete are both destructive tests and non destructive test
- Destuctive test for compressive and tensile strength
- NDT for statci young’s modulus  and dynamic elastic modulus
- Curing was done with artifical sea water for 5 months

**Note Try to understand the logic behind the chloride content result**

**Conclusion**

- The test result of the study show that the tenary blend of OPC, FA and SF is complementary in which SF improves the early age performance of concrete and FA refines the properties of the hardened concrete as it matures
- Mix 5 is the best mix for strength of the concrete and mix 9 is the best mix for the durabilty of the concrete against chloride ion attacks

### Annotations

>This paper investigates the influence of using environmental by-product materials (silica fume and fly ash) in concrete on the chloride ion permeability of concrete

**Comment**: The aim of the study

>The studied parameters include the main fresh and hardened concrete properties such as slump, air content, unit weight, compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, static Young’s modulus, and dynamic elastic modulus. Concrete samples were kept in water for 28 days, then immersed in artificial sea water for 5 months. The total and soluble chloride contents were measured through the concrete using the potentiometric titration analysis. The obtained test results indicated that the use of ternary systems in concrete improved the different characteristics of the product concrete and showed a significant resistance to chloride penetration

**Comment**: This is the study methodology

>The two most common causes of reinforcement corrosion are (i) localized breakdown of the passive film on the steel by chloride ions and (ii) general breakdown of passivity by neutralization of the concrete, predominantly by reaction

**Comment**: Major causes of reinforcement corrosion in concrete

>with atmospheric carbon dioxide (Batis and Rakanta, 2005). Sound concrete is an ideal environment for steel, but the increased use of deicing salts and the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in modern environments principally due to industrial pollution, has resulted in corrosion of the rebar becoming the primary cause of failure of this material.

**Comment**: 

>Chloride ions penetrate through the concrete by a solution diffusion process and are dissolved in pre-existing pore water which is relevant to reinforcing steel corrosion through the following effects: (a) slightly reduce the alkalinity of concrete, (b) increase the electrical conductivity of concrete, and (c) depassivate the steel surface even at high alkaline environment. Chloride ions may enter easily into fresh concrete from the mix components, such as cement, aggregate, mixing water and chemical admixtures, or from chloride contaminates.

**Comment**: How chloride Ions attack and enter fresh concrete

>The chloride ions may penetrate into hardened concrete from external sources such as: curing water, deicing salts, salt spray and sea water. Chloride ions may be present in concrete in several states (Ravindrarajah and Moses, 1993): (a) strongly bound by tricalcium aluminate hydrates (and to a lesser extent by tetracalcium alumino-ferrite hydrates) mainly in the form of calcium chloroaluminate, (b) loosely bound (immobilized by calcium silicate hydrates), and (c) free in solution (water-soluble) in the pore space. Furthermore, migration of chloride ions occurs primarily through diffusion processes and the arbitrary limits of diffusion coefficient fall in range of the order of 10−7 and 10−8 cm2/s

**Comment**: Chloride ion presence in concrete

>This paper aims to investigate the influence of using ternary cementitious systems containing ordinary Portland cement, silica fume and fly ash on the chloride ion permeability of concrete. As well as, to assess the effect of the replacement percentage of cement by fly ash and silica fume on the properties of concrete.

**Comment**: Aim and objective of this research

>The materials were put into the mixer as follows: first; coarse aggregate followed by sand, then cementitious materials (OPC, FA, and SF are mixed well before putting into the mixer) added to the mixer. The total mixing time is 3 min divided into two stages, starting with 60 s dry mixing and then the required water (mixed with chemical admixture) is added within 30 s, then mixer continues for the next 1.5 min of mixing. After casting, the concrete specimens were compacted by a vibrator. The test specimens were stripped from their molds the day after casting. The specimens were cured in water until the testing time

**Comment**: The mixing process of the study

>The properties of hardened concrete were measured by means of destructive and non-destructive tests. Compressive strength and tensile strength are performed via the destructive tests, while the static young’s modulus and dynamic elastic modulus were carried out via the non-destructive ones

**Comment**: Tests conducted

>The compressive strengths of silica fume concrete (mixes 4 and 5) are higher than those of all studied mixes at all ages. The control mix (OPC) shows higher strengths than those of mix 2 (15% FA) at ages 7 and 28 days, while the results of ages 3, 90 and 180 days of mix 2 indicate a lower compressive strength compared with the control mix. Mix 3 of fly ash shows lower compressive strengths than those of the control concrete at all ages due to the effect of high replacement percent (25%) of fly ash. The mixes of ternary systems show lower compressive strength than those of OPC mix (control mix) at age 3 days. Moreover, mix 7 (25% FA and 5% SF) give a compressive strength lower than the control mix at ages 7, 28, 90 and 180. On the other hand, mix 6 (15% FA and 5% SF) give a compressive strength higher than the control mix at ages 7, 28, 90 and 180

**Comment**: Compressive strength test result comparisom for the various mixes

>The test results show that ternary blends of Portland cement, silica fume, and fly ash offer significant advantages over binary blends and plain Portland cement. Also, the combination of silica fume and fly ash is complementary: the silica fume improves the early age performance of concrete with the fly ash continuously refining the properties of the hardened concrete as it matures

**Comment**: Major conclusion of the study based on the strength of the concrete

>Mix 5 (10% SF) is the best mix in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength and elastic modules, while mix 9 (25% FA and 10% SF) is the best mix in terms of chloride resistance.

**Comment**: Best mix for strengh and durablilty conclusion
