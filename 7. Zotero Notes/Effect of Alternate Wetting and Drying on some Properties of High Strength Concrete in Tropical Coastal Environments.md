**Abstract**

- The study is about the investigation of the effect on the compressive strength and some transport properties of concrete subjected to alternate wetting and drying exposure due to intermittent rains, rise and fall of the sea, an exposure type that is commonly experiences in coastal areas.

**Methodology**

Materials Used:

- Cement (OPC)
- Aggregates
- Salt solution(Laboratory Made)

Test Methods:

- Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV)
- Water Ingress test
- Chloride penetration test

**Conclusion**

- The research found out that curing under alternate wet and dry conditions can have an adverse effect on the strength properties of concrete

### Annotations

>High strength concrete samples were prepared and subjected to two different curing regimes, one in which the concrete samples were cured continuously under water, and the other in which the concrete samples were subjected to 12-hr curing under water followed by 12-hr curing under ambient air

**Comment**: Methodology of the study

>The results obtained from the tests conducted, generally showed that the strength and transport properties of the high strength concrete was greatly affected by the alternate wetting and drying curing method. The effect was seen to be more adverse at the later ages than at the early ages

**Comment**: Result of the study

>However, in all these studies, very little attention was given to coastal regions in tropical environments. This is significant, as coastal regions in tropical environments like Nigeria are well known for their peculiar temperature ranges. For example, in Lagos, Nigeria, the temperature ranges from ⁓23°C to ⁓33°C. Hence, there is need to understand how alternate wetting and drying exposure conditions will impact on the properties of concrete in such regions

**Comment**: I think this is the research gap addressed by this study

>In this study, the strength and some transport properties of high strength concrete cured under alternate wetting and drying conditions is compared with that cured under ideal conditions (i.e. continuously under water). The outcome of this study is significant as it will give more understanding about the performance of concrete structures in the coastal regions of Nigeria – a region that has a coastline of over 1,000 km and houses many marine concrete structures such as harbours, jetties, quays, seaports and breakwaters

**Comment**: I think this is point of the study

>A total of 36 concrete cubes were used in the study

**Comment**: I will be needing close to this amount

>triplicate samples of the concrete

**Comment**: Three identical samples of concrete cubes

>This is because of the effect of the premature drying of the concrete samples during the drying cycle, which can result in the formation of thermal cracks within the concrete. Pulse velocity measurements that were taken on the concrete samples indeed confirmed this, when higher pulse velocity readings were obtained for the concrete samples that were cured continuously under water as against those that were subjected to the alternate wetting and drying curing method

**Comment**: So UPV help determine reason for premature drying for concrete

>It should be noted that other factors such as the duration of the wetting or drying cycle as well as the chloride concentration of the salt solution, can affect the properties of the concrete; however, these were not investigated in this study

**Comment**: Research Gap of the study


- Chloride concentration of salt water or solution factor during the wet/dry cycle effect on the properties of concrete
