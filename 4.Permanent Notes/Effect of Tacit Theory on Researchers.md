Tacit Theories affect how we view and observe the environment around us. This spread to how we conduct research about topics and how we form hypothesis base on our findings. It in some ways can constrainst your research in a number of ways. One example of this could be if you have a tacit theory that respecting authority is always good and therefore that all challenges to authority reflect badly on people. This theory might lead you to deem anyone who confronts authority as problematic versus seeing that context mediates whether an authority figure should be respected and what that means and looks like.
