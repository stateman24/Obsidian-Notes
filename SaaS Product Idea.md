A **mobile  for:

1. **Real-time Material Inventory Management**
    - Scan/track blocks, cement, steel, etc. (via QR/barcodes or manual entry).
    - Auto-calculate remaining quantities vs. project needs.
    - Alert when stocks are low or materials are overused.
2. **Digital Site Notes & Client/Artisan Communication**
    - Voice-to-text notes during site meetings (no more lost scribbles!).
    - Assign tasks to artisans with deadlines (e.g., "Plumber: Fix piping by Friday").
    - Share updates with clients via PDF/WhatsApp directly from the app.
